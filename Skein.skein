I had never really gone west of the alley, that area tended to be too filled with hoodlums to warrant a visit. Maybe I could find CG's killer there?

I peeked around, just managing to make out him walking up to Rakesh. I saw them exchanging some words. I couldn't exactly make out what they said, as the speech sonded muffled, like I was sitting inside a car watching the road go by. Both of them walked out, and I could finally hear what they were saying:&#x000A;"No, not really. Ought is not a question of morality Rakesh. Here, let me give you an example, from the statement 'He is a captain' you can logically infer the conclusion that 'He ought to do whatever a captain ought to do'. That shows that an 'is' premise can entail an 'ought' conclusion."&#x000A;&#x000A;"I still don't seem to understand."&#x000A;&#x000A;"That's fine, I have some books in my study that I'll show you.

As I passed faceless sheltered souls I couldn't help but think about one of those passing me by. I trudged on, passing these thoughts by as mere flickers of a cruelly optimistic imagination, trying to play tricks on me and distract me from my goal. I looked around and saw an old favorite restaurant of mine to the west, an Indian place that served the best chaat.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Both of them walked out, and I could finally hear what they were saying:&#x000A;"No, not really. Ought is not a question of morality Rakesh. Here, let me give you an example, from the statement 'He is a captain' you can logically infer the conclusion that 'He ought to do whatever a captain ought to do'.

I couldn't exactly make out what they said, as the speech sonded muffled, like I was sitting inside a car watching the road go by. Both of them walked out, and I could finally hear what they were saying:&#x000A;"No, not really. Ought is not a question of morality Rakesh. Here, let me give you an example, from the statement 'He is a captain' you can logically infer the conclusion that 'He ought to do whatever a captain ought to do'. That shows that an 'is' premise can entail an 'ought' conclusion."&#x000A;&#x000A;"I still don't seem to understand."&#x000A;&#x000A;"That's fine, I have some books in my study that I'll show you.

Both of them walked out, and I could finally hear what they were saying:&#x000A;"No, not really. Ought is not a question of morality Rakesh. Here, let me give you an example, from the statement 'He is a captain' you can logically infer the conclusion that 'He ought to do whatever a captain ought to do'. That shows that an 'is' premise can entail an 'ought' conclusion."&#x000A;&#x000A;"I still don't seem to understand."&#x000A;&#x000A;"That's fine, I have some books in my study that I'll show you.

Here, let me give you an example, from the statement 'He is a captain' you can logically infer the conclusion that 'He ought to do whatever a captain ought to do'.

    <command xml:space="preserve">baudrillard</command>
    <result xml:space="preserve">God is dead but the hyperreal is alive and kicking. Our forms of information and communication are only signifiers - words are references to the real. Originally, the real thing created what references it, but Baudrillard indicates that in the age of mass media we no longer create signifiers to refer to reality, we create reality based on our signifiers. For example, Coca-cola is just another liquid but through our interpretation of it via ads and discourse we give it a brand and a certain legitimacy. Then, through a circular process, signs start to only signify other signs, not anything real, i.e. my interpretation of something will eventually be just based on your interpretation of it, which is based on someone else's. Thus, the creation of meaning is no longer about real things but just an exchange of empty signifiers devoid of real meaning. This is the hyperreality and it neutralizes any truth in messages and medium. The hyperreal is fundamentally unstable because there is nothing behind it to support it -- it is supposed to implode from lack of power but it lives on meanings given to it by people who assume it has meaning. The explosive idealism of the 1AC prevents the coming implosion of hyperreality by giving meaning to the meaningless - only embracing the implosion can collapse the simulation.&#x000A;&#x000A;The 1AC's revolutionary attempt to revive the university fails because their method of meaning production is already dead - their mythical nostalgia for a sense of justice keeps the already corrupted system alive. Only the alternative, by embracing the rotting of these institutions, can dissolve the system.&#x000A;&#x000A;The alternative is to recognize radical alterity - refusing to ascribe a fixed identity to the Other means the system cannot assimilate the Other&#x000A;That means order-driven solutions like the aff's policy approach can't solve - they paradoxically increase disorder in the system which causes their own impacts&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Debate resource inequities - open source helps novices, independents, and lowly funded debaters. Stealing evidence is good. Big schools will backchannel ev anyways, all you do is hurt small schools. Resource inequities control how people engage in debate which is key to accessibility.&#x000A;Antonoucci 05&#x000A;Open source systems are preferable It's better to share the wealth open systems may be the only answer to resource inequities.

Evidence ethics - Open source helps verify cards aren't miscut. Prep time is not enough to actually check their sources. Ev ethics is a voter otherwise there would be no debate, just who can read the most miscut evidence. People get fired and expelled for this in the real world, it's a good norm.&#x000A;&#x000A;3. Clash - If debaters know what exactly their opponent reads and not just what the article says they'll be able to better engage in the round. Key to education cuz we get more in-depth debate. &#x000A;&#x000A;4. Wiki rules - it says you should open source, means this shell isn't arbitrary and there IS a brightline for disclosure, no "endless disclosure" args.&#x000A;&#x000A;5. Reciprocity - most debaters open source. My opponent gets access to cites and cards for cases and prep, which improves quality ground and means they can predict what other people are running, but we can't predict them. This outweighs-a) every reason disclosure is good is an advantage for them and not me, view their counter-interp with a grain of salt since it's self-serving. Reciprocity key to fairness-ensures equal access to the ballot.&#x000A;&#x000A;Voters:&#x000A;1. Fairness is a voter because debate is a competitive activity&#x000A;2.

    <result xml:space="preserve">Crime scene&#x000A;I hadn't even known her for that long - CG - but her loss nonetheless pulled strings within my heart that I never knew existed. There she was, lying in the grimiest alleyway in Manhattan and all I could do was stand there powerlessly with my hands in my pockets like I was some chump schoolboy. I knew I had missed something important, more than just the death of a friend, but I was as lost as a jazz pianist in a vaudeville show. The only thing left for me to do would be to get revenge; if not for her sake then to rest my uneasy soul. As my eyes glanced over the scene I saw CG lying in front of me, and a dumpster to my north.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see CG here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

The idle droning of cars was only cut short by a horn once in a while, breaking the monotony. If I remembered correctly Steve's Fine Establishment was a short walk east of here. I had never really gone west of the alley, that area tended to be too filled with hoodlums to warrant a visit. Maybe I could find CG's killer there?&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>
